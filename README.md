StudentMentalHealthSQL

“The StudentMentalHealthSQL repository focuses on exploring student data using PostgreSQL in a Jupyter notebook. 

The aim is to investigate whether the length of stay is a contributing factor to the ongoing depression issue among international students in Japan. 

By analyzing the data, I hope to gain insights that could help address mental health concerns among this population.”
